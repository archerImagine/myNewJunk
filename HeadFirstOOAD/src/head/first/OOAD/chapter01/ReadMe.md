This is the first Chapter learning of **Head First Object Oriented Analysis & Design (OOAD)** by **Bertt Mclaughlin**,**Gary Pollice** and **David West** 
This markdown file is my notes for the first chapter, not sure if any copyright issues are there.

Encapsulation & Delegation.
-

### BULLET POINTS
* It takes very little for something to go wrong with an application that is fragile.
* You can use OO principles like encapsulation and delegation to build applications that are flexible.
* Encapsulation is breaking your application into logical parts that have a clear boundary that allows an object to hide its data and methods from other object.
* Delegation is giving another object the responsibility of handling a particular task.
* Always begin a project by figuring out what the customer wants.
* Once you've got the basic functionality of an app in place work on refining the design so it's flexible.
* With a functional and flexible design, you can employ design patterns to improve your design further and make your app easier to reuse.
* Find the parts of your application that change often, and try and separate them from parts of your application that don't change.
* Building an application that works well but is poorly designed satisfies the customer but will leave you with plain, suffering, and lots of late nights fixing problems.
* Object oriented analysis and design (OOA&D) provides a way to produce well-designed applications that satisfy both the customer and the programmer.
