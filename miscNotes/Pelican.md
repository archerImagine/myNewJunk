# Pelican Blog Creation #

I would like to create a tutorial blog for my learning of code for various use. The plan is as follows.

* Create a github pages configuration.
* Create a pelican blog on github pages.
* Register a domain.
* Create a AWS account. Link it to the domain.
* Use the pelican blog to host it from S3 in AWS.
* Find a CI/CD pipeline where my markdown gets published automatically into AWS.
*
