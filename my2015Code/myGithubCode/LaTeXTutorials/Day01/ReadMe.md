# Lesson 1 - The first Document #

A latex documents have code and content together much like markdown, though the amount of code is more compared to markdown. There are control structure in a Latex documents which decides which formatting to apply.

The most simplest latex file will be:-

````
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
    Hello World!
\end{document}
````

Few things to note in the above Sample.

* Some of code starts with `\` backslash, these are command and not normal text.
