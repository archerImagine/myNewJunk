# Latex Tutorials #

I am trying to learn latex and this are my learning notes. These are the two websites which I am using to learn.

* [Latex-tutorial ](http://www.latex-tutorial.com/tutorials/beginners/lesson-1/)
* [Getting Started with LaTeX ](http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwilkins/LaTeXPrimer/)

I am starting with **Latex Tutorials,** because it is much easier to follow than the other article.
