# myBlogDevelopment
This is a repository is to make my own website, which will be static at first and then will try to change it to dynamic.

This task has a lot of background work which needs to be completed before we can jump right into it.

I will share and update this main README file, when something I found is generic, remaining I will post it inside the respective folders README.

    - [Pelican Configuration ](Pelican/ReadMe.md)
* GitHub.
    - Before we buy a domain, or even think of web hosting, we can use GitHub Pages, to test these local blog pages, and once we are satisfied we will decide on moving it to a web hosting environment.
    - I have created a `gh-pages` branch for this, and the URL of the static site will be [MYSITE](http://archerimagine.github.io/myBlogDevelopment/mySite/).
    - Here are some links for GitHub pages.
        + [GitHub Pages ](https://pages.github.com/), select the project Site.
