<h2><a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html">Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years by Peter Norvig </a></h2>
<p>This link is a great article on how actually to learn programming, because the author was very much irritated over the Books Series <strong>Teach Yourself <LanuageName> in 24 Hours</strong>.</p>
<p>There are some things in life which takes time, like a child is born in 9 months, programming cannot be learned in a time frame, you can have basic understanding of syntax etc, but you will never gain the capability to exploit the intricacies of the language.</p>
<p>As a reference he tells that if you have to Learn in Hours, then <strong>Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years</strong>   </p>
<p>The <strong>recipe</strong> to become a great programmer is.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Develop <strong>Interest</strong> in programming, do not learn programming for a better job, salary etc. Actually have interest in it.</li>
<li><strong>Practice daily</strong>, never break the chain, but do not practice the same thing everyday, challenge yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Interact</strong> physically and virtually with fellow programmers, Read Others code.</li>
<li>Work on Project with others, be good in some and be the worst in others.</li>
<li>Learn programming language of different paradigm.</li>
<li>UnderStand the Computer in <strong>Computer Programming</strong>.</li>
