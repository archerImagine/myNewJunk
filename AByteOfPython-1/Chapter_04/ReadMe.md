# Chapter 04 | First Steps #

There are two ways to run a python programs.

* The Interpreter prompt.
* Source Editor.

## The Interpreter prompt. ##
We can launch the python interpreter by writing `python ` in the command prompt, in a Unix environment it will be Terminal.

The above command will only work if the `python ` interpreter is present in the `PATH` variable.

## Source Editor ##

There are number of editor which we can use to write python code, because we cannot use the interpreter every time we need to write big files.

The various editors are.

* vim
* emacs
* PyCharm

## Using a source file. ##

We can save a python source like `hello.py`, this can be executed from command line like this.

````
python hello.py
````

The Python interpreter executes each line in the file `hello.py` one after the other. Each line is called a `statements`.


## Getting Help ##
We can get help on any function or statement in Python with help of `help()` method.

* `help(`len`)` : will give information about the `len` function.
