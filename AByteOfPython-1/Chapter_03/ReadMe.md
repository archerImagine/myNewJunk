# Chapter 03 | About Python #

Python is a very simple and powerful language to learn. This is a much favored languages for beginner to learn as we do not have to focus to much on the syntax, and focus mostly on the logic.

Python syntax is almost as easy as a pseudo code.


## Features of Python ##

The main feature which make python irresistible are:-

* **Simple.**
* **Easy to learn.**
* **Free and Open Source.**
* **High Level Language.**
* **Portable.**
* **Interpreted.**
* **Object Oriented.**
* **Extensible.**
* **Embeddable.**
* **Extensive Libraries.**

### Simple ###

Python syntax is as easy as a pseudo code, reading a program in Python looks like reading a English text, though a little strict language grammar.


### Easy to learn ###
Python is very easy to learn, with a very simplistic syntax. I cannot reiterate enough how easy the syntax of Python is.

### Free and Open Source ###
Python is *FLOSS*, i.e. Free/Libre and Open Source Software. What this means is we can distribute software made from this language for free, read someone else software's source code for free.

### High Level Language ###
Python does not weigh its weight on the user to manage memory etc, so this is a very high level language. This is almost same as Java but dissimilar to language like C.

### Portable ###
Python have been already ported on a number of platforms, this is been achieved because of the Open source nature of the language, where a lot of people from the community have contributed towards this porting.

### Interpreted ###

We have two type or programming languages.

* Compiled.
    - The Compiled languages like 'C', we compile the complete source code to a machine language which the underlaying platform understand like a desktop or a embedded system.
    - Due to the compiled nature of these languages, they can exploit the power of the underlying hardware.
* Interpreted.
    - Python is a Interpreted language, which means it is not directly converted to a machine language, The python interpreter converts the code to byte code. This byte code is then run on the target platform.
    - With interpreted language it becomes much easy to move the source code to any platform on which python is already ported, and this will work out of the box.

### Object Oriented ###
Python supports both

* Procedure oriented programming
    - A procedure oriented programming is focused on reusable function code. In this approach we mostly define functions which is reused by other.
* Object oriented programming
    - In OOP, the programs are built considering Object, which combines the data and functionality.

### Extensible ###
If we need a piece of code to run very fast or want to have some piece of algorithm which should not be opened, we can code this part in C/C++ and then use it from a Python program.

### Embeddable ###
We can embed python script within C/C++ programs to give scripting capabilities for the program users.

### Extensive Libraries ###

Python has a extensive library, which including the standard library. If you think of anything there is already a library which might be already available in Python.
